Q) Hyphenize

---------

Max Execution Time: 3 Secs

Objective of the program is to find increasing and decreasing patterns in the given input and Hyphenize it based on the sequence found. 
The sequence can be of intervel 1,2,3

For example: 
1) abcde
can be hyphenized as a-e with an interval of 1.

2) aceg
can be hyphenized as a-g with an interval of 2.

Hyphenization should work for lower, capital and digits. 
For example: NO need to recognize 101112 as a sequence of 10-12. However 01234 should be recognized as 0-4. 
At the same time 89:; should NOT be recognized as 8-; Similar lower and upper case bounds should be honored.

Your program should recognize both increasing and decreasing sequences. I.e. a string sequence of abcdefFEDCBA should be recognized as a-fF-A properly.
A sequence of ABCDEDCBA should be recognized as A-EE-A properly as well.
3 Makes a sequence, not 2

(NOTE: IF PARTIAL SCORING IS ALLOWED IN THE TEST, RECOGNIZING AT LEAST ONE DIRECTION WILL GIVE YOU PARTIAL SCORE)

Here a-f$1 denotes a-f is a sequence with interval of 1 character
